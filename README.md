# Urban Heat Island Intensity Prediction
## Introduction
This project is dedicated to studying and predicting the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, a significant urban environmental issue where city areas experience higher temperatures than their rural counterparts. The UHI effect contributes to various challenges, including increased energy usage for cooling, worsening air quality, and heightened health risks due to elevated temperatures. Our approach involves a rigorous process of data collection, preprocessing, and application of machine learning ensemble models to understand and predict this phenomenon.
